      <p>Baby Driver<br>
        Talented getaway driver Baby (Ansel Elgort) relies on the beat 
of his personal soundtrack to be the best in the game. After meeting the
 woman (Lily James) of his dreams, he sees a chance to ditch his shady 
lifestyle and make a clean break. Coerced into working for a crime boss 
(Kevin Spacey), Baby must face the music as a doomed heist threatens his
 life, love and freedom.<br>
        Release date: June 28, 2017 (USA)<br>
        Director: Edgar Wright<br>
        Budget: 34 million USD<br>
        Screenplay: Edgar Wright<br>
        Music composed by: Steven Price<br>
      Baby Driver is one wild ride</p>
      <p>So yeah, Baby Driver is pretty much a musical; La La Land 
without the singing and dancing and without Ryan Gosling, it’s Drive 
without the brutal head-bashing in the elevator and without.. erm.. Ryan
 Gosling, it’s Fast and Furious without the need for a frontal lobotomy 
and without Vin Diesel and it’s Heat without.. ummm.. well basically 
it’s Heat.</p>
      <p>There are LITERALLY a gazillion reasons to go see Baby Driver. Allow me to break it down to a five-shift gear-box’ worth.<br>
        From the get-go we know we’re in for a ride. Baby is a getaway 
driver. As soon as the bevy of bank robbers burst out from the back seat
 armed to the teeth and striding across the road in perfect unison, we 
know. They’re moving to the beat of their own drum, to the beat of 
Wright’s hand-crafted and lovingly curated collection of cracker tunes 
and into the box office in what will undoubtedly be one of the best 
movies of the year.The cast is top notch. Ansel Elgort is Baby, Baby 
Driver. Kevin Spacey is Doc. Doc owns him, and Baby wants out. Lily 
James is Debora, and Baby’s heart belongs to Debora. Everyone from John 
Hamm to Flea to Jon Bernthal to Jamie Foxx are bad-ass bank robbers, 
some badder than others. This is balls to the floor high-octane top gear
 car chase heaven. All set to the best ‘On the Road' playlist known to 
mankind. Squealing smoking tyres, hand-break 180s/360s, insane 
cops-chase-criminals from freeway to the fast lane to the wreakers yard.
 Maximum acceleration for maximum exhilaration.A script dripping with 
enough quotable quotes to keep even the most quote-hungry equipped until
 the end of time.A story that actually keeps you guessing without 
second-guessing your guessing, with enough heart to warm your own, and 
enough hilarity amidst the car-nage to keep the laughing gear 
well-lubricated.So, yeah, what I said before. Go see it.<br>
        Five stars.<br>
        Baby Driver opens in cinemas tomorrow.<br>
        Baby Driver movie review: common car-nage<br>
        Baby Driver is so hot, so cool, so exciting! Well, the opening 
sequence is, at least, the one bit in the movie that actually feels like
 Edgar Wright directed it.tweet Fresh-faced getaway driver Baby waits in
 the car and we do too while a bank heist is happening in the 
background. Haha! A heist movie that isn’t about the heist at all! This 
is the driver’s movie, and he’s only about the driving, and nothing 
else. Except the music. He is also about the music — the classic rock 
and pop and soul and blues and jazz — in his headphones that he bops to 
not only while driving but while waiting: drumming on the steering 
wheel, flipping the wipers on and off in time to the tunes. Edgar Wright
 makes sure that we are all Baby at that moment, any of us who have ever
 sat in a car listening to music, and even those of us who’ve never done
 that but feel the romantic pull of the road and our tunes anyway.</p>
      <p>That’s how good Edgar Wright is. In the opening sequence of his new movie, anyway.</p>
      <p>And then the escape! Wow, Baby is also badass behind the wheel 
once the car is in motion, all zippy dangerous donuts and making the 
cops crash into one another (and into civilians, too), all over the city
 streets and freeways of Atlanta. Whee! The crisp snappy visual dynamic 
extends to the opening credits sequence, too, after the heist is over, 
in which Baby dance-strolls along the sidewalk from their<br>
        hideout to grab coffee for the post-crime breakdown and 
money-split. Baby isn’t just a badass driver: he’s a badass walker. 
(Baby Walker sounds like those little wheeled chairs that infants use to
 scoot around before they can keep to their feet on their own, though, 
so ixnay on that for an awesome movie title.)But then… that’s it. Baby 
Driver still has another hour and 40 minutes to go, and it never reaches
 that level of breezy magnificence again. Not even close. Not visually, 
and not thematically, either: the insouciance of laid-back criminals 
gives way to tedious angst and handwringing.tweet I can’t recall ever 
before seeing a movie that gave up this early: usually they wait till 
the last act to poop out on us, to run out of ideas and steam. Perhaps 
the only truly original thing about Baby Driver is its astonishing pivot
 from gripping opener to rote plot full of totally unsurprising clichés:
 Baby (Ansel Elgort: Insurgent, The Fault in Our Stars) doesn’t really 
want to live a life of crime, but boss Doc (Kevin Spacey: Horrible 
Bosses 2, Margin Call) is blackmailing him. Baby is so tormented, so 
haunted by the memory of his dead mother. (I’m really tired of the 
biggest influence a woman can have on a male protagonist onscreen is to 
be absent.) Baby has a new girlfriend in 
diner-waitress-with-a-heart-of-gold Debora (Lily James: Pride and 
Prejudice and Zombies, Cinderella), who, like so many other 
ill-conceived female love interests in men’s stories, appears to have no
 friends or family to warn her that her new crush is bad news, and 
nothing to keep her from deciding on a whim that it would be a good idea
 to toss out her entire life and run away with him. (Newsflash to male 
screenwriters, ie Wright in this case: Maybe men don’t have friends, and
 that’s actually really sad, but women do. And we talk to our friends 
about what we’re doing with our lives. We are not solitary robots 
waiting for you to awaken us and take us away from all of this. We do 
not buy women like Debora. She is not us, and she is not whom we aspire 
to be.)Edgar Wright used to send up cinematic clichés with gusto and 
with huge humor: that’s what Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz were all 
about, and they both remain a joy to watch today. Here he merely 
embraces the clichés in the most straightforward and unironic way… a way
 that’s pretty dour, too. (Elgort’s Baby comes across mostly as a sullen
 child.tweet We don’t care much what happens to him, or whether he will 
extricate himself from his supposedly unwanted situation.) I kept 
waiting for the twist, the thing that would clue me in to the big 
overarching joke,tweet the moment in which Baby Driver would pop back to
 the snazzy life it had at the beginning. And that moment never 
comes.Baby does do a couple more getaway jobs with rotating gang members
 including Bats (Jamie Foxx: Annie, The Amazing Spider-Man 2) and couple
 Buddy (Jon Hamm: Keeping Up with the Joneses, Absolutely Fabulous: The 
Movie) and Darling (Eiza González: Jem and the Holograms) — oh, is he 20
 years older than her? *yawn* — but there is no zing to any of it. 
Oddly, though, there is one sequence, a shootout that Wright 
synchronizes to “Tequila” playing on Baby’s iPod, which is “supercool” —
 or so we’re meant to take it — but also unintentionally disconcerting. 
Because we’re also meant to understand that Baby doesn’t like guns 
(except when he does use one, as in the image at the top of this review)
 and hates this shootout, so what the heck are we supposed to feel here?
 Wright mostly lets his signature visual and auditory style be squashed 
by the supposed needs of mainstream filmmaking — the first time he 
attempted to go full-on Edgar Wright in a studio movie was Scott Pilgrim
 vs. the World, which flopped — to the point where this barely even 
feels like his work… and the one moment in which he lets it spring up 
again is completely at odds with the story he wants to tell.Perhaps most
 disappointing of all, however, is that there’s barely many more nervy 
and audacious automobile stunts after that tease of an opening sequence,
 just mostly stock car chases set to a hip retro soundtrack. If Baby’s 
not very engaging and his driving is mostly absent, what we did come for
 again? Boss tunes are not enough.<br>
        Baby Driver </p>
      <p>BABY DRIVER</p>
      <p>***</p>
      <p>DIRECTED BY Edgar Wright</p>
      <p>STARS Ansel Elgort, Kevin Spacey</p>
      <p>Guaranteed to reign as the hipster fave of 2017, Baby Driver 
comes tearing off the starting line and leads the summer-movie field for
 the duration of the ride. Only when it hits the final stretch does it 
become clear that a little more maintenance while still in the shop 
might have subsequently allowed it to enjoy a few more victory laps.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, this style-over-substance endeavor does itself 
proud as one of the few worthwhile achievements in what’s turning out to
 be a rather desultory cinematic season thus far. Writer-director Edgar 
Wright deserves the lion’s share of the kudos, not only for assembling a
 note-perfect cast but also for providing them with dialogue that’s 
often a pleasure to encounter. Landing many of the best lines is Kevin 
Spacey, cast as a verbose crime boss who masterminds a series of bank 
heists.</p>
      <p>Spacey’s Doc likes to use different players for different jobs,
 but he always keeps one constant on the team: Baby (Ansel Elgort), a 
taciturn getaway driver who choreographs all of his moves (both in and 
out of the car) to the tunes emanating from his iPod.</p>
      <p>(In this manner, Baby is not unlike Guardians of the Galaxy’s Peter Quill, who similarly shimmies to the beat of his Walkman.)</p>
      <p>Baby is so quiet and reserved that his demeanor endears him to 
some of his accomplices while enraging the rest. For their part, 
lovebirds Buddy (Jon Hamm) and Darling (Eiza Gonzalez) like the kid; 
conversely, Griff (Jon Bernthal) and Bats (Jamie Foxx) do not. As for 
Baby, the only person who interests him is Debora (Lily James), the new 
waitress down at his favorite diner.</p>
      <p>Between the character dynamics, the vehicular stuntwork (much 
of it not CGI), and the carefully chosen soundtrack, Baby Driver clicks 
on all cylinders — at least until it hits the homestretch. Suddenly, a 
storyline that had admirably been kept edgy and unexpected turns careful
 and conventional, with unlikely character pirouettes and an 
overextended climax — one, I might add, featuring a villain seemingly as
 indestructible as Terminator 2’s T-1000 — emerging as the primary, 
predictable culprits.</p>
      <p>That’s a shame. Certainly, Baby Driver establishes its own 
irresistible rhythm — one which deserves a sizable audience — but when 
it perhaps matters most, it turns out that the song remains the same.<br>
        Movie Review – Baby Driver (2017)</p>
      <p>Baby Driver, 2017.</p>
      <p>Directed by Edgar Wright.<br>
        Starring Ansel Elgort, Kevin Spacey, Jon Hamm, Lily James, Jon Bernthal, Eiza Gonzalez, CJ Jones and Jamie Foxx.</p>
      <p>SYNOPSIS:</p>
      <p>After being coerced into working for a crime boss, a young getaway driver finds himself taking part in a heist doomed to fail.</p>
      <p>To say that Baby Driver is a sublime piece of filmmaking is an 
understatement. Sitting at the back of Edgar Wright’s mind for many 
years, it’s finally come to light after his disappointing and bitter 
exit from Ant Man. Baby Driver is Wright at his finest; it’s a car chase
 movie and a musical rolled into one.</p>
      <p>Baby (Elgort) has been stuck working as a getaway driver for 
local crime boss Doc (Spacey) since he was a kid and he can’t wait to 
escape. Baby suffers from tinnitus and plays music constantly to drown 
out the “hum in the drum”. After meeting diner waitress Debora (James), 
Baby thinks he can get away from his old life but is continually dragged
 back into it. Baby Driver is a visual feast that has one of the best 
and most lovingly put together soundtracks that I’ve heard since 
Guardians of the Galaxy.<br>
        Elgort is perfect in the titular role and is able to hold his 
own against heavyweights like Spacey, Hamm and Foxx. He has the boyish 
charm required for the character and is also believable as the uber 
talented getaway driver with more tricks up his sleeve then you can 
imagine. With the addition of a stellar supporting cast (Foxx is truly 
exceptional as the unhinged criminal Bats) and a sharp witted script, 
Baby Driver is one of the most original films I’ve seen in years. Whilst
 it is clearly influenced by True Romance, The Driver and Bonnie &amp; 
Clyde, it still has its own identity and Edgar Wright’s style has never 
shone brighter. It’s also a ton of fun to watch.<br>
        Baby Driver review – boy racer hits all the right notes<br>
        After wisely walking away from the car crash of Marvel’s 2015 
film Ant-Man, Shaun of the Dead director Edgar Wright is back in the 
fast lane with his most thrillingly cinematic romp. A romantic musical 
disguised as a car-chase thriller, Baby Driver combines the over-cranked
 action fantasies of Hot Fuzz with the poptastic sensibilities of Scott 
Pilgrim vs the World. At its centre is Ansel Elgort’s eponymous getaway 
driver, who uses earphones to drown out the “hum-in-the-drum” of 
tinnitus (the result of a childhood accident) and orchestrates his life 
to carefully chosen iPod playlists. Whether he’s burning rubber or 
fixing a peanut butter sandwich (“right up to the edges”), this former 
joyrider spins his wheels and records with the same infectious 
exuberance. Think An American in Paris meets The French Connection, or 
Walter Hill’s The Driver as remade by Baz Luhrmann – it really is that 
much of a blast.Accidentally indebted to smooth criminal Doc (Kevin 
Spacey), Baby is always “one more job” away from freedom. At home he 
cares for foster father Joseph (CJ Jones), who listens to music with his
 fingertips, and from whom Baby has learned signing and lip-reading – 
invaluable skills. At work he’s surrounded by wild cards: Buddy and 
Darling (Jon Hamm and Eiza González), a latter-day Bonnie and Clyde with
 matching his and hers tattoos; Bats (Jamie Foxx), a loose cannon who 
claims the monopoly on “mental problems”; Jon Bernthal’s ever-gruff 
Griff; rocker Flea’s Eddie No-Nose (formerly Eddie the Nose – don’t 
ask); and Lanny Joon’s JD, who “puts the Asian in home invasion”.The 
only sure thing in Baby’s life is his growing love for waitress Debora 
(Lily James), who does indeed “look like a zebra” in her black and white
 diner uniform, and who sings “B-A-B-Y” to herself as she waits tables, 
dreaming of heading west “in a car I can’t afford, with a plan I don’t 
have”. The ghosts of Tony Scott’s True Romance and Jim McBride’s 
Breathless (and the movies that inspired those films) haunt their 
whirlwind romance, a pulp fiction mash-up of comic-strip tropes, fired 
by palpable human chemistry.Anyone familiar with Wright’s 2003 music 
video for Mint Royale’s Blue Song, in which Noel Fielding danced in the 
seat of a parked getaway car, will know that the writer/director has 
been nurturing Baby Driver for years. Indeed, the film opens with an 
explicit nod to its small-screen dry run, with Elgort lip-synching to 
Bellbottoms (“fabulous, most groovy”) by the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion
 while his cohorts rob a bank. Later, he halts a job until he’s 
correctly cued up the frantic bass riff opening of the Damned’s Neat 
Neat Neat, and searches for Golden Earring’s Radar Love before flooring a
 jacked ’86 purple Chevy Caprice. As for that “one killer track”, Queen 
fetishist Wright brilliantly turns to Brighton Rock to provide battling 
guitar accompaniment to a multistorey showdown of head-banging 
elegance.It’s not just the action sequences that strike a chord. The 
toe-tapping opening titles find Baby doing an on-foot coffee run to the 
beats of Bob &amp; Earl’s Harlem Shuffle, lyrics magically appearing on 
walls and signs in a scene as seamless as the opening freeway dance from
 La La Land. At times the songs serve as an on-the-nose Greek chorus, 
telling us that Baby has “nowhere to run to, nowhere to hide” as he’s 
trapped in an arms deal. But it’s when the horns and drums of the Button
 Down Brass’s Tequila become gunfire, or the madness of Hocus Pocus by 
Focus drives a breathless chase, that Wright really puts his foot down, 
with exhilarating results.“You’re either hard as nails or scared as 
shit,” Baby is told, although like the young bucks of Ferris Bueller’s 
Day Off or Risky Business, he’s actually a bit of both. As for Wright, 
he directs with the confidence of someone who can afford to pay fanboy 
homage to his antecedents, whether casting Paul Williams as the Butcher 
in a nod to Smokey and the Bandit, or getting Kevin Spacey to bark 
“Don’t feed me any more lines from Monsters Inc… it pisses me off!”</p>
      <p>A top-flight stunt co-ordination team (Darrin Prescott, Robert 
Nagle, Jeremy Fry) and a hip choreographer (Ryan Heffington) work 
together in perfect harmony, while cinematographer Bill Pope uses the 
Atlanta locations with the same affection that John Landis brought to 
Chicago in The Blues Brothers. If you want a soporific night out, go see
 Hampstead. For something with a little more torque, then, Baby, it’s 
you.</p>
